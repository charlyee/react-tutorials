/**
* This file is going to be the primary configuration file for this react project. This is where if you want to make
* wide sweeping changes to the react project then you would make modifications in this file.
* For instance look at the versions, dependencies and scripts of this file....
* It's for this reason that I recommend you only alter things in this file if you're really aware of what you're doing.
* If you're not confident and sure what you're doing-- my strong advice is ask a TA. This can result in extremely painful
* to debug errors if handled oddly.
