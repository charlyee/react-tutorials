<!--
  This is not too different from your normal index.html file... But unlike prior projects, this should be kept EXTREMELY clean
  and not have components or whatever else involved. This should be kept as thin as possible and added to minimally.

  Yes you can change things like the head, the title, and the rest. But the core bulk of your react application is
  actually tied in through the <div> with the id=root. This is going to be identified and locked onto by the index.tsx file.
    ... Note that that is INDEX.TSX not index.html! This is index.html! index.tsx is a react-typescript file! 
    Very different!

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
